Lacàphê serves as a sanctuary for coffee and tea enthusiasts in San Jose, California, specializing in authentic Vietnamese beverages as well as Boba tea. The café not only offers an array of unique drinks like Egg Coffee and Eggspresso Hanoi but also provides a bustling atmosphere that resonates with the local community. It is a destination popular for those who seek variety in their caffeinated experiences.

## Our goal

The website will serve as a valuable online presence, offering information about the shop, its menu, promotions, and a means for customers to place online orders. This website will help increase the shop's visibility, customer engagement, and sales. The website will showcase items on the menu and include their prices over multiple different web pages. There will be an "About" page where customers will be able to gain insights into the shop's motto, core beliefs, and decisions behind establishing a boba tea shop. It will also feature an online order page that will connect the customer to a different website, such as Doordash, to order items through an on-demand food delivery platform. Online ordering will be through a third-party website. The website will feature links to the shop's social media profiles, increasing their social media visibility and promoting their business. The customers will have the ability to create an account and be able to log in. The client will be able to create an account that they will be able to log into. Some features, such as the ability to edit and add pictures, write item descriptions, and set/change prices of items will be available exclusively for the client. A tracker to track the number of customers visiting the website on a weekly/monthly/yearly basis.
